The titlepic package allows you to place a picture on the
title page (cover page) of a LaTeX document.

Example of usage:
\usepackage[cc]{titlepic}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\titlepic{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{picture.png}}

Note: the package currently only works with the document
classes article, report and book.
